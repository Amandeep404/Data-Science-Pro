    "## Feedforward Neural Network Structure\n",
    "A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is a type of artificial neural network characterized by a uni-directional flow of information between its layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic structure of an FNN consists of:\n",
    "### Input Layer: \n",
    "Receives the input data, which is propagated forward through the network.\n",
    "### Hidden Layers:\n",
    "One or more fully connected layers, where each neuron applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs. These layers introduce non-linearity to the model, enabling it to learn and represent complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "### Output Layer:\n",
    "Produces the final output of the network, often with a specific activation function, such as softmax for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn and represent complex patterns in the data. Without non-linearity, a neural network would essentially behave like a **linear regression model**, regardless of the number of layers it has.\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not by calculating the weighted sum and further adding bias to it. Common activation functions include:\n",
    "- Sigmoid\n",
    "- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)\n",
    "- Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)\n",
    "- Softmax\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Activation functions introduce non-linearity by:\n",
    "- Thresholding the output (e.g., ReLU)\n",
    "- Mapping the output to a specific range (e.g., sigmoid)\n",
    "- Introducing non-linear transformations (e.g., tanh)\n",
    "This non-linearity enables the network to learn and represent complex relationships between inputs and outputs, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, including classification, regression, and feature learning."

    "# CNN Convolutional and Pooling Roles\n",
    "Convolutional layers are a fundamental component of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They are designed to extract features from input data, such as images, by scanning small regions (called filters or kernels) across the data. Each filter learns to recognize a specific pattern or feature, such as edges, lines, or textures. The output of a convolutional layer is a feature map, which represents the presence and strength of the detected features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The role of convolutional layers is to:\n",
    "### Extract local features:\n",
    "Convolutional layers focus on small, local regions of the input data, allowing them to capture subtle patterns and details.\n",
    "### Translate equivariance:\n",
    "Convolutional layers are equivariant to translations, meaning that the same feature is detected regardless of its position in the input data.\n",
    "### Hierarchical feature representation:\n",
    "Multiple convolutional layers with different filter sizes and numbers can create a hierarchical representation of features, from low-level (e.g., edges) to high-level (e.g., objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pooling Layers in CNN:\n",
    "Pooling layers, also known as downsampling layers, are commonly used in CNNs to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps while preserving important features. The primary goals of pooling layers are:\n",
    "### Spatial downsampling: \n",
    "Pooling layers reduce the number of pixels in the feature map, decreasing the computational requirements and memory usage of subsequent layers.\n",
    "### Translation invariance: \n",
    "Pooling layers introduce translation invariance, making the network less sensitive to the position of features within the input data.\n",
    "### Feature aggregation: \n",
    "Pooling layers aggregate features from neighboring regions, allowing the network to focus on more robust and representative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common pooling techniques are:\n",
    "-  Pooling: Selects the maximum value from each region (e.g., 2x2 grid).\n",
    "- Average Pooling: Calculates the average value from each region.\n",
    "In summary, convolutional layers extract local features and hierarchical representations, while pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions, introduce translation invariance, and aggregate features, enabling the network to focus on more robust and representative features."

This is achieved through a self-looping or recurrent workflow, where the hidden layer can remember and use previous inputs for future predictions.\n",

    "In contrast to feedforward neural networks, which process data independently and forget previous inputs, RNNs use this internal state to process sequential data one step at a time.

    "- Speech recognition and speech synthesis\n",
    "- Time series forecasting and prediction\n",
    "- Handwriting recognition and other sequential pattern recognition tasks\n",
